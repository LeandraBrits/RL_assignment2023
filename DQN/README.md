## Double DQNs

This part of the repo will be focused on implementing an agent using DDQNs.

Much of the code here was extended from the starter code provided to us for the DQN lab.

For an in-depth description of the code implemented here and the results of our agent's runs, read [this report](https://www.overleaf.com/read/crvsbknrwtpr#71ca17)
